# Customer-Segmentation
## The goal of this project is to segment customers of a retail business based on their purchasing behavior in order to surface actionable insights for marketing, product offerings, and customer retention strategies.

The dataset contains historical sales transactions, including product details, quantities, prices, invoice dates, and customer identifiers. These transactions span a diverse product catalog and a broad customer base, ranging from occasional buyers to frequent, high-value clients.
Over time, the company has observed that different customer groups exhibit unique purchasing patterns â€” some shop seasonally, others regularly; some focus on high-value items, others on bulk purchases. However, marketing campaigns have so far been executed without clear customer segmentation, which limits personalization and the efficient allocation of resources.
Now that the company is investing in data-driven decision-making, the objective is to identify distinct customer segments through clustering techniques. These insights will help:

- Tailor marketing strategies to each segment.
- Optimize promotions and product recommendations.
- Improve customer retention through targeted engagement.
